    <h2>Hey guys,</h2>
    <p>This week we will be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - <br> 
        <span>another important game guideline</span> </p>

        <h2>Youtubability</h2>
        <p>
            A key driver of youtubality is the <strong>clarity of  your gameplay </strong>
         to a potential player.
        </p>
    <p>Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game 
        by working on getting the potential of your game by working on getting
        <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong>  for your games.</p>

    <p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer.
</p>

<p>For instance ask yourself if a user's interaction with the game is <strong>evident</strong> for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> 
    Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second(great!) or after 10 seconds(too long!)
</p>

<p>

    Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules.For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong>(i orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

    if you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is interesting to show them the 30 seconds video before making them try to prototype in order to
     <strong>understand their </strong> expectations from the video vs the actual game they try.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help 
        <strong>understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the traget used in Viatcheslav Tarasov's PurpleDiver or Fabrika Games'Draw with the spacededicated to drawing.

<p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone's Facebook feed,
    </strong> everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
<strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay videos is understandable if someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on Youtube just because it has an attractive thumbnail-it's the same idea for your game videos.
